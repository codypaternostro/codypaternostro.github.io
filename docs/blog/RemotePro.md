## PowerShell: RemotePro

## Overview

> Hello! My name is Cody Paternostro, and this is my project, RemotePro. It is an intriguing module that allows anyone familiar with MilestonePSTools and Milestone XProtect to interact through a graphical user interface (GUI). The idea for RemotePro originated when Joshua Hendricks, the developer behind the MilestonePSTools project, shared an interesting PowerShell script. This script wasnâ€™t designed for automation; instead, it focused on user interaction by enabling the viewing of live and playback streams from a Video Management System (VMS). He utilized Windows Presentation Framework (WPF), which was new to me at the time. This journey has been a long one, providing an opportunity to create something usable by everyone with minimal effort.

## Getting Started
